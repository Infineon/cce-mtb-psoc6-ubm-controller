# PSoC 61 UBM controller application

This is a basic code example to showcase the Universal Backplane Management (UBM) middleware features. The code example details how to configure the UBM hardware and illustrates the firmware update using the [MCUboot](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/releases/tag/v1.8.3-cypress) library.

The UBM middleware provides the implementation of UBM. PSoC&trade; 61 is used as UBM controller in the UBM hardware. Because there is no BSP available for PSoC&trade; 61 in ModusToolbox&trade;, you need to either use the custom BSP (`TARGET_ELROND_BACKPLANE`) shipped with this code example or create a custom BSP for PSoC&trade; 61 by following the instructions in [Creating a custom BSP for PSoC&trade; 61](#creating-a-custom-bsp-for-psoctrade-61).


**Note:** This code example is a Beta version; some features of the UBM middleware is not available in this code example.


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/design-support/tools/sdk/modustoolbox-software/) v3.1 or later (tested with v3.1)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 4.0.0
- Programming language: C



## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU ArmÂ® Embedded Compiler v10.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`



## Supported kit

This code example uses a customized UBM hardware setup with PSoC&trade; 61 MCU in it. A custom BSP (TARGET_ELROND_BACKPLANE) for the UBM hardware is shipped with the code example. You need to import this BSP while creating the application.


Any one of the [PSoC&trade; 6 development kits](https://documentation.infineon.com/html/psoc6/hsg1651214227031.html) can be used by replacing the MCU on the board with PSoC&trade; 61 MCU.


## Hardware setup

This code example uses a custom UBM hardware setup. The UBM hardware setup has UBM midplane and UBM backplane which contain the UBM controller. [PSoC&trade; 61](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex-microcontroller/psoc-6-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4-mcu/cy8c6136bzi-f14/) is used as the UBM controller.


## Software setup

This code example requires no additional software or tools.

The UBM requires the following:

 - [emeeprom](https://github.com/Infineon/emeeprom) v2.20.0.

 - [MCUboot](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot) v1.8.3.

See the [UBM middleware release notes](./RELEASE.md) for release-specific information.



## Quick Start

See the [API Reference Guide Quick Start Guide](https://infineon.github.io/ubm/html/index.html) section for step-by-step instruction on how to enable the UBM middleware.


## Using the code example

**Note:** It is recommended to use a new workspace.

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

**Note:** It is recommended to use the custom BSP(TARGET_ELROND_BACKPLANE) provided with the code example while creating the application.

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog (i.e., after opening Project Creator, click **Browse** > **Directory** and select the custom BSP (TARGET_ELROND_BACKPLANE)).

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

   **Note:** In this step, create the application picking custom BSP (TARGET_ELROND_BACKPLANE). This is because there are no official PSoC&trade; 61 kit. You need to either use the custom BSP (TARGET_ELROND_BACKPLANE) shipped or build your own BSP; later sections describe the required steps.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional

`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[PSoC 61 UBM controller application](https://github.com/Infineon/cce-mtb-psoc6-ubm-controller)" application with the desired name "cce-mtb-psoc6-ubm-controller" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062S2-43012* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 --app-id cce-mtb-psoc6-ubm-controller --user-app-name cce-mtb-psoc6-ubm-controller --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```
**Note:** To work with custom BSP (TARGET_ELROND_BACKPLANE), use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the custom BSP.

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Creating a custom BSP for PSoC&trade; 61

ModusToolbox&trade; does not have a BSP for PSoC&trade; 61 that is used as the UBM controller. Therefore, a custom BSP (TARGET_ELROND_BACKPLANE) is shipped with the code example. You can either import this BSP or can create a custom BSP for PSoC&trade; 61 using either of the two methods detailed below.

### Method 1: Using a generic BSP and BSP Assistant

See [BSP Assistant user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/infineon-ModusToolbox_BSP_Assistant_1.0_User_Guide-UserManual-v02_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c8386267f0183a972f45c59af) for detailed instructions on creating a new BSP for PSoC&trade; 61 from a generic BSP.


### Method 2: Base on *CY8CKIT-062S2-43012* BSP

The BSP for PSoC&trade; 61 can be created from the *CY8CKIT-062S2-43012* kit with some changes made for PSoC&trade; 61. Follow the steps detailed in the [Custom BSP for PSoC&trade; 61](https://github.com/Infineon/cce-mtb-psoc61-mcuboot-bootloader#custom-bsp-for-psoc61) section to create a BSP for PSoC&trade; 61.

**Note:** Ensure that the pins used in the backplane control signals are not reused for any other resources.

**Note:** You can use CLI version of the BSP Assistant tool for these configurations. See the [BSP Assistant user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/infineon-ModusToolbox_BSP_Assistant_1.0_User_Guide-UserManual-v02_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c8386267f0183a972f45c59af).



## Operation

You should use a proper UBM hardware setup to run this PSoC 61 UBM controller application code example.

This document expects you to be familiar with MCUboot and its concepts. See [MCUboot documentation](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot) to learn more.

This example bundles two applications: the bootloader and the UBM_controller run by CM4. You need to build and program the applications in the following order. Do not start building the applications yet: follow the [Step-by-step instructions](#step-by-step-instructions).

1. *Build and program the bootloader* - On the next reset, CM4 runs the bootloader and prints a message that no valid image has been found.

2. *Build and program the UBM_controller in BOOT mode (default)* - On the next reset, the bootloader will let CM4 run the UBM_controller app from the primary slot.

3. *Build and program the UBM_controller in UPGRADE mode by setting the `IMG_TYPE` make variable to `UPGRADE`* - On the next reset, the bootloader will copy this new image from the secondary slot into the primary slot and let CM4 run the image from the primary slot. You have the option to make the upgrade image permanent in the primary slot or revert to the image that was in the primary slot on reset.



### Step-by-step instructions

1. Connect the UBM controller to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Install the dependent modules for the [imgtool](https://pypi.org/project/imgtool/) Python module for image signing and key management.

   MCUboot already includes this module, but not the dependent modules. Do the following:

   1. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the *\<mtb_shared>/mcuboot/\<tag>/scripts* directory.

      On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu.

      In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

   2. Run the following command to ensure that the required modules are installed or already present ("Requirement already satisfied:" is printed).

      ```
      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
3. Ensure that the following configurations are made before building the application:

   1. Open *ubm_bootloader/shared_config.mk* and ensure that  `FLASH_MAP` is set to `psoc6_overwrite_single.json`.

   2. Open *ubm_bootloader/flashmap/psoc6_overwrite_single.json* and ensure that `application_1` and `upgrade_size` are set to `0x20000`.

   3. Open *ubm_controller/imports/ubm/mtb_ubm_config.h* and ensure that the macros `MTB_UBM_UPGRADE_AREA_START` and `MTB_UBM_UPGRADE_AREA_SIZE` are set as follows:

      ```
      #define MTB_UBM_UPGRADE_AREA_START      (0x10018000U)
      #define MTB_UBM_UPGRADE_AREA_SIZE       (0x20000U)
      ```
   4. Ensure that the PSoC&trade; 6 pins used to map DFC and HFC (see the `ubm_backplane_control_signals` structure in *ubm_controller/main.c*) are not reused anywhere else in the application.

4. Build and program the bootloader application.

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the 'bootloader' application in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, navigate to *\<application>/bootloader* and execute the `make program_proj` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:

      ```
      make program_proj TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program_proj TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>


5. Build and program the UBM_controller in BOOT mode.

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the 'bootloader' application in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

      </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

      From the terminal, navigate to the *\<application>/UBM_controller* directory and execute the `make program_proj` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target.

      ```
      make program_proj TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program_proj TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

   </details>

6. After programming, the bootloader starts automatically and lets CM4 run the UBM_controller application.

7. Build (Do **NOT** program) the UBM_controller application in UPGRADE mode.

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the 'UBM_controller' application in Project Explorer.

      2. Edit the Makefile and update the value of the `IMG_TYPE` variable to `UPGRADE`.

      3. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **Build \<Application name>**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

      From the terminal, navigate to the *\<application>/UBM_controller* directory and execute the following command to build the application using the default toolchain to the default target:

      ```
      make build_proj -j8 IMG_TYPE=UPGRADE
      ```
   </details>

8. Program the UPGRADE image using the Scrutiny tool. See [Firmware update using the Scrutiny tool](#firmware-update-using-the-scrutiny-tool).

   **Note:** The Scrutiny tool is owned by Broadcom Corporation. You must adhere to the Broadcom Corporation policies to obtain and use the tool. Currently commands that will upgrade the controller image are not supported by the current version of the Scrutiny tool.

9. After programming, reset the hardware. This will start the bootloader automatically, upgrades the image by copying the image from the secondary slot into the primary slot, and lets CM4 run the UBM_controller application.

**Note:** Current version of the UBM Middleware does not support hitless bootloading. Therefore, you need a hard reset after programming the upgrade the image.

**Note:** You can build the combined image for the bootloader and UBM_controller applications using the `make build` CLI command in the *\<application>* directory but during the linking stage, there might be an error stating multiple definition of symbols for UBM_controller for `BOOT` and `UPGRADE` image. Currently the solution to the problem has been addressed in the following code section of the *\<application>/UBM_controller/Makefile* which ignores the build artifacts of the other `IMG_TYPE`. For example, if `BOOT` is selected as `IMG_TYPE`, the *\<application>/UBM_controller/build/UPGRADE/* build directory artifacts will be ignored during the compilation and linking of the `BOOT` image.

```
ifeq ($(IMG_TYPE), BOOT)
CY_IGNORE+=build/UPGRADE
else
ifeq ($(IMG_TYPE), UPGRADE)
CY_IGNORE+=build/BOOT
endif
endif
```

For programming the individual builds of the bootloader app and UBM_controller app, use the `make program_proj` CLI command as mentioned in the above steps.


## Debugging

Debugging pins are disabled in the BSP because debugging pins are used for the UBM middleware initialization in the UBM hardware setup. Therefore, debugging is disabled in the PSoC 61 UBM controller application.


## Design and implementation

As explained at the beginning, this code example bundles two applications: the bootloader application and the PSoC 61 UBM controller application. The PSoC 61 UBM controller application is directly programmed into the flash to quickly evaluate the MCUboot operation.

This code example uses ModusToolbox&trade; software resources such as BSPs and PSoC&trade; 61 MCU to provide a rich development experience that aligns well with other code examples based on ModusToolbox&trade; software.

Design and implementation are similar to that of the [mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic) example except that both bootloader and applications are designed to run from CM4 CPU and tested on only PSoC&trade; 61 device.

The PSoC 61 UBM controller application is updated to run the UBM middleware; this application will initialize the UBM middleware with UBM backplane control signals and UBM backplane configurations.
The `mtb_ubm_init()` function call will initialize the UBM middleware.

Parameters for the `mtb_ubm_init()` function:

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
`mtb_stc_ubm_backplane_cfg_t` <br> `ubm_backplane_configuration` | These parameters have the configurational values required to set up the UBM middleware. <br> Holds the configuration value for the following: <br> 1. `fru_config` â Holds the storage configuration of the EEPROM (EEPROM is chosen as the FRU) <br> 2. `overview_area` â Overview area that holds the UBM FRU overview area configuration structure<br> 3. `silicon_identity` â Holds the controller device code and controller vendor-specific data <br> 4. `backplane_info` â Holds the details of backplane type & backplane numbers <br> 5. `capabilities` â Holds the I/O signal configurations <br>  6. `hfc_routing` â Holds the UBM controller slave address of HFC
`mtb_stc_ubm_backplane_control_signals_t` <br> `ubm_backplane_control_signals` | These parameters contain the GPIO definition for HFC and DFC I/O signals. The number of elements of this configurational array should match the number of HFCs and the number of DFCs configured. These signal definitions are a combination of SFF-TA-1005, SFF-8639, SFF-TA-1001, SFF-TA-1009, SAS, and SATA standards. Change the pin settings to match your specifications.
`mtb_stc_ubm_context_t` | Contains internal middleware data structures; not intended to be changed by the application.


## Firmware update using the Scrutiny tool

The Scrutiny tool will make the application to download the updated image and write the image into the secondary slot that is available in flash memory. When the UBM initialization is successful, the host will communicate with the UBM controller by I2C (the UBM controller as the slave and the host as the master); the host can send UBM controller commands to the UBM controller using the Scrutiny tool.

### Sequence of Scrutiny commands

The following sequence of commands is used in the Scrutiny tool to download the updated image to the UBM controller.

Sl. No. | Command | Description | Code
--------|---------|-------------|-----
1 | **Enter Programmable mode** | Unlocks the UBM controller for image update mode. This command internally calls the `handle_enter_programmable_update_mode()` handler function. | `0x20`
2 | **Programmable Mode Data Transfer** | Defines the subcommands that are used to update the UBM controller image | `0x21`
3 | **GET NON VOLATILE GEOMETRY** | Returns the non-volatile storage structure and size of programmable segments |  `0x01`
4 |**ERASE**| Erases a segment of the non-volatile storage specified by the sector number and sector index | `0x02`
5 |**ERASE STATUS** |Verifies the status of the `ERASE` command | `0x03`
6 |**PROGRAM** | Writes the UBM controller image to a segment of non-volatile storage in the UBM controller. Non-volatile storage segment is specified by the sector number and sector index. | `0x04`
7 |**PROGRAM STATUS** | Verifies the status of the `PROGRAM` command | `0x05`
8 |**VERIFY** |Verifies a segment of non-volatile storage by specifying the sector number and sector index | `0x06`
9 |**VERIFY STATUS** | Returns the status of the last `VERIFY` command and the checksum of the non-volatile storage segment specified in the last `VERIFY` command | `0x07`
10 |**VERIFY IMAGE** | Verifies an image in the non-volatile storage. A specific image can be verified by giving the image number. | `0x08`
11 |**VERIFY IMAGE STATUS**| Returns the validity of an image based on the image number specified in the last `VERIFY IMAGE` command | `0x09`
12 |**SET ACTIVE IMAGE** |Sets a specified image to use when the UBM controller exits programmable update mode | `0x0A`
13 | **ACTIVE IMAGE STATUS** | Returns the status of the `SET ACTIVE IMAGE` command | `0x0b`
14| **Exit Programmable Update Mode** | Makes the UBM controller exit programmable update mode | `0x22`

<br>

Once the valid image is present in the non-volatile memory, MCUboot will automatically take care of switching the application to the upgraded UBM controller image.
